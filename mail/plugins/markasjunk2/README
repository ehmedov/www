Roundcube Webmail Mark as Junk 2
================================
This plugin adds "mark as spam" or "mark as not spam" button to the message menu.

When not in the Junk mailbox:
  Messages are moved into the Junk mailbox and marked as read

When in the Junk mailbox:
  The buttons are changed to "mark as not spam" or "this message is not spam"
  If the message is a spam report with the original email attached then this is detached and saved in the Inbox, the spam report is deleted
  If it is not a spam report then the message is simply moved to the Inbox

This plugin also integrates with the ContextMenu plugin
