Roundcube Webmail SAUserPrefs
=============================
This plugin adds the ability for users to edit they SpamAssassin user prefs
from within Roundcube. It interacts with preferences storied in a database via
SQL. For more information on setting up SpamAssassin to work with a database
please see http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/UsingSQL.
Tested with SpamAssassin Version 3.2.3
Inspiration for this plugin was taken from:
WebUserPrefs <http://sourceforge.net/projects/webuserprefs/>

(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).

Even if skins might contain some programming work, they are not considered

Install
=======
* Place this plugin folder into plugins directory of Roundcube
* Add sauserprefs to $rcmail_config['plugins'] in your Roundcube config
NB: When downloading the plugin from GitHub you will need to create a directory
called sauserprefs and place the files in there, ignoring the root directory in
the downloaded archive.

Config
======
The default config file is plugins/sauserprefs/config.inc.php.dist
Rename this to plugins/sauserprefs/config.inc.php
* You must set the database connection string
* Enter the table name, name of the username field, preference field, and value
field

Changing the order of the sections
==================================
To change the order of the sections add a sections attribute with the sections
listed in the desired order to the sasectionslist object in
skins/[skin]/templates/sauserprefs.html
eg: <roundcube:object name="sasectionslist" id="sections-table"
     class="records-table" cellspacing="0"
     sections="general,tests,bayes,headers,report,addresses" />

Whitelist Sync
==============
This plugin contains an option to synchronise changes to your RC address book
and your SpamAssassin whitelist.

Delete user bayesian data stored in database
============================================
If the bayesian data is stored in the same database as the user prefs then it
is possible for users to delete their data from the UI.
See config file for example SQL

"SERVICE CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE! Error No. [500]" Error Message
================================================================
On some setups users might see "SERVICE CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE! Error No.
[500]" shows up at the top of the sauserprefs screen. In this case there could
be a problem with the database connection. Try adding ?new_link=true to the end
of the sauserprefs DSN in the config file. For example:
$rcmail_config['sauserprefs_db_dsnw'] =
'mysql://username:password@localhost/database?new_link=true';
